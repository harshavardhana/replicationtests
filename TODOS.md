## Replication sanity tests
- [x] Setup 2-zone docker-compose source side
- [x] Setup 1 zone docker-compose dest side
- [x] Create setup-script.sh to create aliases, replication config, targets
- [x] Test1 - replicate,compare metadata, replication status; file diff
- [x] Test2 - multipart replication test
- [x] Test3 - metadata version update replication test
- [x] Test4 - test if tag replication occurs
- [x] Test5 - test if legalhold replication works
- [x] Test6 - test if object retention metadata replicates
- [x] Test7 - test if delete marker replicates
- [x] Test8 - test if permanent delete of version replicates

- [x] Setup bi-directional replication
- [ ] Test both ends of a bi-directional setup for symmetry of version stack
